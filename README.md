# Introduction
Welcome to the README documentation for the Ship-Fish Unity game. This document will provide an overview of the game mechanics, controls, and implementation details.

# Game Description
Ship-Fish is a 2D game where you control a ship that collects various types of fishes in the ocean. Fishes can be of different types - regular, burning, or exploding. The player can spawn fishes randomly by right-clicking, and the ship can collect the fishes by left-clicking on them.

# Objective
The objective of the game is to collect as many fishes as possible before the game ends. Be careful with the exploding fishes, as they can cause damage to your ship!

# Controls
Right Click: Spawn a random fish (regular, burning, or exploding).
Left Click: Command the ship to collect fishes.
Gameplay Mechanics
The game has two distinct phases of gameplay mechanics:

# Part 1: Ship Goes to Oldest Fish
In this part, the ship prioritizes collecting the oldest fish first, based on their spawn time.
The ship navigates through the ocean to reach the oldest fish and collects it before moving on to the next oldest fish.
# Part 2: Ship Goes to Nearest Fish
In this part, the ship prioritizes collecting the nearest fish.
The ship calculates the distance to each fish and moves towards the nearest one for collection.
